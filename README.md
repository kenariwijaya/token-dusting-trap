# TokenDustingTrap

A smart contract trap for detecting token dusting attacks on Ethereum wallets. This trap monitors incoming token transfers and alerts when unknown tokens are sent to watched wallets, which is a common pattern in dusting attacks used for privacy invasion and tracking.

## Overview

Token dusting is a technique where attackers send small amounts of tokens to multiple wallet addresses to track and deanonymize users. This trap helps detect such attacks by monitoring for transfers of unknown tokens to specified wallet addresses.

## Use Cases

### 1. **Privacy Protection for Individual Users**
- **Scenario**: A privacy-conscious individual wants to monitor their wallet for potential dusting attacks
- **Implementation**: Deploy the trap and configure it to monitor your primary wallet address
- **Benefit**: Receive immediate alerts when unknown tokens are sent to your address, allowing you to take privacy measures

### 2. **Institutional Wallet Security**
- **Scenario**: A DeFi protocol or exchange wants to monitor their treasury wallets for suspicious activity
- **Implementation**: Set up the trap to monitor multiple institutional wallet addresses
- **Benefit**: Early detection of potential tracking attempts or reconnaissance activities against institutional funds

### 3. **High-Value Wallet Monitoring**
- **Scenario**: Whale wallets or high-net-worth individuals need advanced security monitoring
- **Implementation**: Configure the trap to monitor whale addresses for dusting patterns
- **Benefit**: Detect potential targeted attacks or surveillance attempts against high-value targets

### 4. **DeFi Protocol Security**
- **Scenario**: A DeFi protocol wants to protect user privacy by detecting dusting attacks on user wallets
- **Implementation**: Integrate the trap into the protocol's security infrastructure
- **Benefit**: Provide users with dusting attack alerts as part of the protocol's security features

### 5. **Compliance and Risk Management**
- **Scenario**: Financial institutions need to monitor for potential privacy attacks on customer wallets
- **Implementation**: Use the trap as part of a broader compliance and monitoring system
- **Benefit**: Maintain audit trails of potential privacy invasion attempts

### 6. **Research and Analytics**
- **Scenario**: Blockchain researchers studying dusting attack patterns and prevalence
- **Implementation**: Deploy the trap to monitor a sample set of addresses for research purposes
- **Benefit**: Collect data on dusting attack frequency, timing, and token types used

### 7. **Multi-Wallet Portfolio Protection**
- **Scenario**: Users with multiple wallets want comprehensive monitoring across their entire portfolio
- **Implementation**: Configure multiple instances or modify the trap to monitor multiple addresses
- **Benefit**: Centralized monitoring of dusting attempts across an entire wallet portfolio

### 8. **MEV Protection Services**
- **Scenario**: MEV protection services want to alert users about potential privacy invasions
- **Implementation**: Integrate the trap into existing MEV protection infrastructure
- **Benefit**: Provide comprehensive protection against both MEV attacks and privacy invasions

## How It Works

The trap monitors blockchain data for token transfers and triggers an alert when:
1. A token transfer is directed to a monitored wallet address
2. The token being transferred is not in the known/trusted token list
3. The transfer matches dusting attack patterns (typically small amounts from unknown sources)

## Contract Features

- **Immutable Wallet Address**: The contract owner's wallet is set at deployment and cannot be changed
- **Flexible Monitoring**: Can monitor any wallet address by configuring the input data
- **Unknown Token Detection**: Specifically looks for transfers of tokens not marked as "known" or trusted
- **Alert System**: Returns structured data when dusting is detected, including token address, sender, recipient, and amount

## Integration

This trap is designed to work with the Drosera monitoring system and can be integrated into:
- Personal security dashboards
- DeFi protocol alert systems  
- Institutional monitoring tools
- Privacy-focused wallet applications
- Blockchain analysis platforms

## Security Considerations

- The trap only monitors and alerts; it does not prevent dusting attacks
- Users should implement additional privacy measures when dusting is detected
- Consider rate limiting and gas optimization for high-frequency monitoring scenarios
- Ensure proper access controls when integrating into larger systems
